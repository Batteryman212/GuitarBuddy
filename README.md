# GuitarBuddy

Guitar Buddy is a digital instructor for guitar lessons. The project is being built for the ECE 445: Senior Design class. Fall 2018.

## Getting Started

The software portion of Guitar Buddy consists of two programs: one for conversion from MIDI to LED array assignments in a dense track structure, and one to actually transmit the dense track structure to the microcontroller as a sparse, "real-time" track structure.
